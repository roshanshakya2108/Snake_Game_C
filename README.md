# Snake Game in C

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game written in C. The snake moves within a bounded area, eats fruits to grow in size, and the game ends if the snake runs into the boundary or itself.

## Features

- Snake moves using the keyboard (W, A, S, D keys).
- Snake grows when it eats fruits (represented by 'F').
- Score increments as the snake eats more fruits.
- Game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.

## How to Play

- `W` : Move Up
- `A` : Move Left
- `S` : Move Down
- `D` : Move Right
- `X` : Exit the game

## Requirements

- A C compiler (like GCC)
- Windows (for `conio.h` and `windows.h` dependencies) or a compatible platform that supports these libraries.
